# AGAPE — Android

A tradition-aware Bible and prayer app for **Eastern Orthodox**, **Oriental Orthodox** and **Catholic** Christians.
Native Android, Kotlin + Jetpack Compose. English by default, Dutch available.

## Build and run

1. Open the repository root in Android Studio (JDK 17+; the Gradle wrapper uses Gradle 8.14).
2. Optional — real accounts: add your Supabase project to `local.properties` (never committed):
   ```properties
   supabase.url=https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co
   supabase.anonKey=YOUR-ANON-KEY
   google.webClientId=YOUR-WEB-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```
   Then apply `supabase/migrations/*.sql` to the project and enable the Email and Google providers.
   Without these keys the app uses a **local development account**, so every screen still works.
3. Run the `app` configuration, or `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Unit tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`.

## App flow

Welcome → Terms → Choose Church → Choose style → Sign in / Create account → Guided tour → Home · Bible · Prayer · Me.
The first visit to Prayer explains the hours and asks to enable notifications (prayer times and inactivity reminders).
